# Distance distributions from MD in xTB with GFN-FF
File `dist_from_md.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook, must be run in the same folder with trajectory file `xtb.xyz` and input file `md_input.inp`.

To use it as .py, execute it with:

`python dist_from_md.py --path_to_xyz_file --path_to_inp_file location_of_first_oxygen location_of_second_oxygen --title`

Good luck!
